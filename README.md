# Responsive Menu for React

This is a responsive menu for React applications, with the capability to include dropdown menus, the repo includes and example on using React Router 'react-router-dom' library to showcase the menu's functionality, however, the Menu component itself doesn't make use of the React Router library, it only provides the URL, based on the menu objects passed from the App.js component.

## Description

Downoload the Menu Folder which includes 2 files, menu.css and Menu.js.
Menu.js is the component file, you can import this into your react component using import, for instance, in the current hierarchy, I'm using:

### import Menu from './Menu/Menu'

inside App.js in order to import the Menu component
Then you can use the Menu component in your App component:

### <Menu />

## Props and control variables:
